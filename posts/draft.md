# Does draft pick really matter?

<div class="subtitle">An analysis of 2024 fantasy football league winners</div>

<div class="author">Written by Kevin Tian</div>

## Introduction

On [ffwrapped](https://ffwrapped.com), almost 3000 unique fantasy football leagues were added for the 2024 season. Among all of these leagues, there were 580 12-team redraft leagues. We're going to take a look at the draft position of the winning league manager in each of these leagues.

## Winners by Draft Position

Despite the modest sample size of 580 leagues, the data reveals a clear advantage for managers with later draft positions. Draft positions 7-12 accounted for 58.1% of league winners, with positions 10 and 11 yielding the highest number of champions.

This advantage correlates strongly with the availability of consistent performers at these draft slots. Managers with later picks often secured two players from an elite group that included A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Saquon Barkley, Jahmyr Gibbs, Kyren Williams, Josh Jacobs, and Jonathan Taylor. Each of these athletes maintained top-8 production at their respective positions throughout the season.

Conversely, early draft positions (1-3) demonstrated significantly lower success rates, primarily due to underperformance from expected elite players. The unanimous #1 overall pick, Christian McCaffrey, missed most of the season due to injury, severely handicapping managers with the first selection. Despite this setback, it's worth acknowledging the impressive 13 managers (2.4% of winners) who overcame this obstacle to secure league championships.

CeeDee Lamb, Tyreek Hill, and Breece Hall were also all selected in the top three and failed to deliver value proportionate to their draft capital. From personal experience as a manager who invested my #3 pick in Tyreek Hill, it hurts to see that only 19 teams (3.2% of winners) won the championship while drafting him in the first round.

Examining the most popular league winners, it's no surprise that Ja'Marr Chase led many managers to victory. His contract negotiations likely depressed his draft position, making him the 3rd or 4th receiver selected, but he finished the season as the undisputed #1 receiver. His 2024 fantasy performance ranks 4th all-timeâ€”trailing only 2023 CeeDee Lamb, 1995 Jerry Rice, and 2021 Cooper Kupp.

## Player Positions

In fantasy football, drafting running backs and wide receivers in the first round is always the obvious choice. 39 (6.7%) league managers decided to go against the grain and draft a quarterback first. These quarterbacks were Lamar Jackson (13), Josh Allen (9), Patrick Mahomes (5), Jalen Hurts(4), C.J Stroud (3), Anthony Richardson (2), Joe Burrow (1), Brock Purdy (1), and Dak Prescott (1).
Other than Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, and Joe Burrow who finished as quarterbacks 1 through 3, it's pretty easy to say that the rest of these quarterbacks were not integral to winning the championship. Lastly, credit to the 3 people that managed to win their leagues with Mark Andrews as their first round pick.

## Conclusion

The 2024 fantasy football season reinforced that draft position alone doesn't determine championship outcomes. Late-round drafters had a clear advantage, but identifying value players like Ja'Marr Chase or taking calculated risks on elite QBs like Lamar Jackson could overcome draft position disadvantages. As we prepare for 2025, remember that adaptability throughout the season ultimately matters more than where you picked in the draft. The best managers found ways to win despite injuries to players like McCaffrey or underperformance from early-round talents like Tyreek Hill.
