# Does draft pick really matter?

<div class="subtitle">An analysis of 2024 fantasy football league winners</div>

## Introduction

On [ffwrapped](https://ffwrapped.com), almost 3000 unique fantasy football leagues were added for the 2024 season. Among all of these leagues, there were 580 12-team redraft leagues. We're going to take a look at the draft position of the winning league manager in each of these leagues.

## Winners by Draft Position

Despite a sample size of only 580 leagues, the data reveals a slight advantage for managers with later draft positions. Draft positions 7-12 accounted for 58.1% of league winners, with positions 10 and 11 yielding the highest number of champions.

This advantage correlates strongly with the availability of consistent performers at these draft positions. Managers with later picks often drafted two players from a consistent, injury-free group that included A.J. Brown, Amon-Ra St. Brown, Saquon Barkley, Jahmyr Gibbs, Kyren Williams, Josh Jacobs, and Jonathan Taylor. Each of these players maintained top 10 production at their respective positions throughout the season.

Conversely, early draft positions (1-3) demonstrated significantly lower success rates, primarily due to underperformance from expected elite players. The unanimous #1 overall pick, Christian McCaffrey, missed most of the season due to injury, severely handicapping managers with the first selection. Despite this setback, there were 13 managers (2.4% of winners) who overcame this obstacle to secure league championships.

CeeDee Lamb, Tyreek Hill, and Breece Hall were also all selected in the top three and failed to meet expectations. This was especially true for Hill, who ended the season as the WR #23 while consistently being the first WR off the board. From personal experience as a manager who invested my #3 pick in Tyreek Hill, it makes sense to see that only 19 teams (3.2% of winners) won the championship while drafting him in the first round.

## League Winners

Examining the most popular league winners, it's no surprise that Ja'Marr Chase led many managers to victory. He was the 3rd or 4th receiver selected (partially due to contract negotiations), but finished the season as the undisputed #1 receiver. His 2024 fantasy performance ranks 4th all time, trailing only 2023 CeeDee Lamb, 1995 Jerry Rice, and 2021 Cooper Kupp.

A common theme among the league winners is that they all had injury-free seasons. Chase, Jefferson, Brown, Robinson, and Barkley all did not miss any games due to injury. It's also interesting to see Jonathan Taylor as the 5th most common league winner. Although he missed 3 games and ended as the RB #9, his 39.8-point performance in week 16 and 26.6-point performance in week 17 likely carried many teams to championships.

## Player Positions

When sorting by position, we can see that most managers made the obvious choice of drafting a running back or wide receiver in the first round. 39 (6.7%) league managers decided to go against the grain and draft a quarterback first. These quarterbacks were Lamar Jackson (13), Josh Allen (9), Patrick Mahomes (5), Jalen Hurts (4), C.J Stroud (3), Anthony Richardson (2), Joe Burrow (1), Brock Purdy (1), and Dak Prescott (1).

Other than Lamar Jackson, Josh Allen, and Joe Burrow who finished as quarterbacks 1 through 3, it's pretty easy to say that the rest of these quarterbacks were not exactly league winners. Managers who did not get one of these top 3 quarterbacks were likely saved by drafting Baker Mayfield (QB #4) or Jayden Daniels (QB #5) with a later pick.

Lastly, there were 3 league winners bold enough to draft Mark Andrews with their first round pick. Considering Andrews was only the TE #5, winning a league with him as your first pick is incredibly impressive. Looking forward to 2025, Brock Bowers may be the only TE worthy of a first round selection.

## Conclusion

The 2024 fantasy football season reinforced that draft position alone doesn't determine championship outcomes. Late-round drafters had an advantage, but identifying value players like Ja'Marr Chase or taking calculated risks on elite QBs like Lamar Jackson could overcome draft position disadvantages. As we prepare for 2025, remember that adaptability throughout the season ultimately matters more than where you picked in the draft. The best managers found ways to win despite injuries to players like McCaffrey or underperformance from early-round players like Tyreek Hill.
